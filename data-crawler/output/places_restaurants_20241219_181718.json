It exceeded all my expectations and delivered great Thai dining experience.\nTheir menu is extensive, with focus on southern Thai cuisine which is known for its bold and complex flavors. The service was quick and friendly. We ordered pad thai, beef curry, stir fry....and everything was good!",

But we sat for 20 mins after arrival with no water as the place seemed VERY short of staff for a busy Saturday lunch, and our second drinks order never actually appeared by the time we had finished our meals. Big portions of interesting food and a lively environment were pluses.",

The pork chops were also very good.\n\nThe dumplings and the blood sausage werenâ€™t impressive. The cod roe was really interesting.\n\nWhile it was good, for that price point and level of hype I was expecting something really impressive, and it wasnâ€™t necessarily that. The kitchen was slow at times with weird waiting times between dishes and then several coming at once. The food was very good but save the eggplant nothing really blew my mind.",

The food was lovely, the atmosphere was lovely and the service was excellent. I'm not going to say it had the best food in town, it didn't, but it was good and we all enjoyed it. Parking is tricky, and if not on a weekend, i can only imagine it to be harder. Allow plenty of extra time to organise parking if you're driving there. Here's a random piece of info, their toilets are nice and clean, however, for some reason, their cubicles have prison grade doors! Very weird, I'm not sure if they are designed to keep people in or out! I put a photo for you to judge for yourself ðŸ¤” All in all it's worth the visit. And of course, expect to pay for the privilege.",
