        "text": "Edit: It is not the responsibility of the customer to find and see all information at every new and unfamiliar establishment, especially when it can be hard to find. Surcharges aren't mentioned on your website or online menu, and signage was NOT obvious in the restaurant. Instead of getting defensive, please learn some humility and take in the feedback for at least future customers before they doubtlessly start to have the same problems. Otherwise you're only reinforcing my original point.\nAlso, the expensiveness in general was a separate issue to the above (not part of the same, as your reply seems to indicate). That said, it is still a valid impression to have, especially after experiencing the dishes. I understand taking pride in what you serve, but please don't call customers' opinions 'inaccurate' just because it's not something you want to hear.\n----\n(Visit date: 19/10/2024)\n\nThe food was good quality, fresh, well-cooked, and overall quite nice; no doubt about it. The restaurant is clean and comfortable, the staff at least nice and friendly at first.\nStill, these things aren't enough to justify the exorbitant prices. Alchemy is EXPENSIVE for what they serve; let that be clear.\nBut that's not the main gripe I had or the reason why I had to post.\n\nI feel like I have to warn everyone about their hidden charges and costs, which I wish I saw in reviews myself before visiting.\n\nBoth staff members who interacted with us, the waiter and an older gentleman we believed may have been the owner, engaged in some deceptive behaviour:\n1. Not informing us of their Saturday surcharge until it was literally time to pay, when unlike Sundays and public holidays it's definitely not common practice\n2. Asking us if we wanted certain sides between dishes without mentioning any prices, giving the impression that they're complementary/free (e.g. the pickles. They turned out to be $13.50 -- for what turned out to be just 2 whole ones! And they were the cheapest item on our bill!)\nTo top it off, when we expressed surprise at the final bill and everything that contributed to it (we were polite, not even angry), seeing how quickly the staff dropped their veneer of friendliness was chilling and unforgettable.\n\nI'd originally wanted to come back to explore more Polish cuisine here, especially when the food seemed promising, but I wouldn't be comfortable doing so anymore. The Polish friend I came with doesn't want to return either. 10% surcharges may not seem like much, but when each item costs so much, they really add up. Also, such dishonesty shouldn't be encouraged anyway. I wouldn't recommend supporting their business unless they change.\n----\nFood-wise--\n\nRecommended:\n- Zurek/sour rye soup (best dish we had)\n- (Fried) Sauerkraut & mushroom pierogi (delicious, the flavour surprisingly deep)\n\nDecent:\n- (Fried) Potato & cheese pierogi\n- Golabki/cabbage rolls\n\nNot recommended:\n- Gonzo Pork Schnitzel (says 'cheese' in the description but is actually a blue cheese sauce, which didn't suit the schnitzel. Also didn't work with the pears; overall it tasted funky and disharmonic)\n- (Fried) Duck & apricot pierogi (apricot couldn't be tasted at all, the main flavour actually an alcoholic tang, which practically covered all of the duck. We wondered if the batch we had was actually off)",

        "text": "Walking into the north end of King Street Newtown after a theatre outing looking for food is bit tricky. Six different restaurants told us the kitchen was closed. Night life is getting harder in Sydney.\n\nThen I remembered the Pastizzi Cafe. I have already written a couple of reviews of their cafe on the south end of King Street. Italian/Maltese hospitality is usually a winner. I thought, I bet they are open later than the others. I was right - their kitchen does not close until midnight.\n\nApart from the usual excellent pastizzi, their menu is ideal for a casual dinner with friends. Plenty of choice of wines and other drinks.\n\nThe photos with this review give you an idea of what some of our group enjoyed.\n\nThe white bait fritters served with a Greek style salad was my choice. The fritters were moist inside and not over fried. The dressing on the salad was a bit strong.\n\nThe four cheese gnocchi (anglo name here) was just so cheesy! The gnocchi were just right and the cheeses were a little over the top - but hey, that is what this dish is all about.\n\nI could not resist the chocolate zuccherato (I think I have the name right). Filled with a chocolate mousse style filling which should not need the cream on the side but oh well just go with it……\n\nThe staff were attentive and the service quick. There were not that many diners in that night so I wonder how the service would go when they are pumping.\n\nPastizzi Cafe is a great option for a late dinner. Now I am a fan of both Pastizzi Cafes - north and south.",
