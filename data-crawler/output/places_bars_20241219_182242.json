The staff are knowledgeable, friendly, and love a good chat about their brews – it’s clear they’re as passionate as they are welcoming. I’m no fan of the sours or fancy brews, but even I found a stellar stout that hit the spot. If you’re after choice, charm, and genuine Aussie vibes, The Beer Bar is a must-visit.",

The cocktails we had were made meticulously and so delicious, definitely unique to any other places in Sydney we have visited.\nOnly feedback I have regarding service is more training for the greeter at the front door. Whilst she was lovely, we were asked almost 3 times “are we done?” It definitely made us feel rushed. We were there for a 6.30pm booking and left at 6:50pm, so I don’t think we overstayed our time allotment, but definitely tainted the experience a tad.",
